# Battleship-game-learning-with-Flatiron-School
I'm done with this weeks homework and reading for Flatiron School Accelerated Boot Camp and Avi hasn't put up the next lesson material yet on learn.co. I can't just stop coding because there is nothing to do. I've decided to make something based off the things I learned from Week 1 in order to retain what I learned and hone my coding craftmanship. This is just a lame Battleship game with a 3 x 3 grid and it requires 1 correct hit to win the game. It seems like a number guessing game but with a grid. I wanted to implement the grid in order to include the && in the if statement. I have also utilized the Math.floor(Math.random()) thingy I learned in the bootcaomp. I have also looked up things on google on how to reference input from a form into javascript.
